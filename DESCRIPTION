Description: Japan’s national cancer genomic medicine program aggregates
    comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) results and linked clinical
    information at the Center for Cancer Genomics and Advanced Therapeutics
    (C-CAT). These data create unique opportunities for large-scale, real-world
    clinicogenomic studies, but effective analysis requires both (i) 
    high-quality clinical questions and (ii) practical tools that clinicians can
    use without building bespoke pipelines. FELIS is an open-source, locally
    deployable web application (R/Shiny) designed for *no-code* interactive
    analysis of secondary-use C-CAT datasets. It provides a point-and-click
    interface for cohort construction, clinicogenomic summarization,
    visualization, and bias-aware outcome analyses. By lowering technical
    barriers while remaining compatible with secured/offline environments,
    FELIS helps clinicians and translational researchers iterate rapidly from a
    clinical question to a reproducible analysis output.
