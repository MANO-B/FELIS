# Summary

Japan’s national cancer genomic medicine program aggregates comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) results and linked clinical information at the Center for Cancer Genomics and Advanced Therapeutics (C-CAT) [@kohno2022ccat]. These data create unique opportunities for large-scale, real-world clinicogenomic studies, but effective analysis requires both (i) high-quality clinical questions and (ii) practical tools that clinicians can use without building bespoke pipelines.

FELIS is an open-source, locally deployable web application (R/Shiny) designed for *no-code* interactive analysis of secondary-use C-CAT datasets. It provides a point-and-click interface for cohort construction, clinicogenomic summarization, visualization, and bias-aware outcome analyses. By lowering technical barriers while remaining compatible with secured/offline environments, FELIS helps clinicians and translational researchers iterate rapidly from a clinical question to a reproducible analysis output.

# Statement of need

Large clinicogenomic resources have accelerated discovery by enabling standardized exploration of molecular and clinical features (e.g., cBioPortal [@cerami2012cbioportal; @gao2013cbioportal] and AACR Project GENIE [@genie2017]). However, C-CAT secondary-use data are typically analyzed in controlled environments under data use agreements, limiting the utility of hosted public portals. Moreover, clinically relevant real-world evidence (RWE) questions in CGP practice often require analysis features that are uncommon in general-purpose genomics portals—for example, survival modeling that accounts for delayed testing and left truncation, which can meaningfully bias CGP-based outcome analyses [@tamura2022lengthbias; @ikegami2023jjcoletter].

FELIS addresses these gaps by offering:

- **No-code cohort building** from de-identified, preprocessed tables derived from secondary-use C-CAT datasets.
- **Bias-aware survival analysis** suitable for CGP settings with delayed entry/left truncation [@tamura2022lengthbias; @ikegami2023jjcoletter].
- **Clinically oriented outputs** (tables and figures) designed for downstream reporting and manuscript preparation.
- **Privacy-preserving deployment** on a local workstation or institutional server (including offline/containerized setups), so sensitive data remain within the user’s controlled environment.

# Software description

## Architecture and deployment

FELIS is distributed as an R package that launches an interactive Shiny application. It supports (i) direct installation from source and (ii) container-based deployment to promote reproducibility across heterogeneous computing environments. The application is designed to be usable in restricted networks commonly required for secondary-use clinical data.

## Data inputs and governance-aware design

FELIS operates on research-use datasets prepared from C-CAT secondary-use programs. Users load standardized, de-identified tables (e.g., patient-level clinical variables, tumor metadata, treatments, and variant-level calls) generated by local preprocessing within their authorized environment. This design keeps FELIS open source while accommodating access control and governance constraints of national clinicogenomic data.

## Core functionality

FELIS provides interactive modules that cover common clinicogenomic workflows:

- **Cohort definition and stratification**: filter and intersect clinical variables (e.g., age, sex, tumor type, stage, lines of therapy) and genomic alterations (genes, variant classes, panels).
- **Genomic summaries and visualization**: alteration frequency summaries, oncoplot-style views, co-alteration exploration, and subgroup comparisons.
- **Outcome analysis**: Kaplan–Meier and regression-based survival analyses with options to handle delayed entry/left truncation in CGP settings [@tamura2022lengthbias; @ikegami2023jjcoletter].
- **Treatment pattern summarization**: descriptive analyses of real-world treatment sequences and therapy exposure among genomically defined subgroups.
- **Export for reporting**: download-ready plots and tables to facilitate communication with multidisciplinary teams and manuscript preparation.

## Extensibility

FELIS currently targets targeted-panel CGP and linked clinical variables in C-CAT. As Japan’s cancer whole-genome sequencing (WGS) programs expand, FELIS is designed to be extensible to standardized WGS outputs (e.g., CaGMeJ) [@cagmej], enabling cross-assay analyses within a single interface.
